basic_test.py

This is a basic test of microstack functionality. We verify that:

1) We can install the snap.
2) We can launch a cirros image.
3) Horizon is running, and we can hit the landing page.
4) We can login to Horizon successfully.

The Horizon testing bits were are based on code generated by the Selinum
Web IDE.
